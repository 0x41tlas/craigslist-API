Pyhton craigslist scraper

Still a work in progress, don't judge

Currently re-writing the whole thing and adding alot of functionality, such as a working proxy connection, as well as automated proxy switching should the former IP get banned (and it will). The module will also verify the proxy connection before continuing the scraping process, as to not accidently reveal the host IP and get you banned.
